# spotify-rfid-player

This is a spin on the record player (pun not intended) using RFID technology and a Raspberry Pi.

I first thought of this project when I replayed Skylanders and wondered how they worked. I found out that they used radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. I wondered if the same idea could be applied to music. I looked online and saw a similar project by talaexe. The link to her project will be listed below. 

Looking at talaexe's code, I noticed that it could be better if I added some sort of data structure to store all the tags id's to save them instead of having lots of if/then statements. Another problem I encountered while following talaexe's tutorial is that Spotify completely changed their developer website. So I had to learn how to use a curl request and how to get an OAuth 2.0 access token manually.
